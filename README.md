Very simple game of rock, paper, scissors to practice the basics of Javascript.

The game is won if the player can win 5 rounds before the computer. Once the game is over, the winner is displayed along with the number of points of the player and the computer.

The no-ui.js file should be ignored. It's there to preserve the original code and see how the project evolved.
